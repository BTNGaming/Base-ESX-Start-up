  * Creating a server requires A TON of patience, and if you don't have patience, you will get very angry, very fast.

### Legalities
Base ESX Start-up Server by BTNGaming

I did NOT create any of these scripts, they are just some of the basic scripts needed to start an ESX Server properly. ALL Credit to the ESX Team and the people who designed and modified/fixed the code.

The only script in here that is not from the [ESX-Framework](https://github.com/ESX-Framework/) Github is esx_billing, I have used this version of [esx_biling](https://github.com/ATG-Github/esx_billing) because it removes some major exploits which can be found [HERE](https://forum.cfx.re/t/esx-security-patches-billing-drugs-illegal-drugs-jail-qalle-jail-communityservice/1292760/1)
